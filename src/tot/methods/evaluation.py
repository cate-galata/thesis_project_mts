#####################
Reference Answer (assumed to be true): {ReferenceAnswer}
Candidate Answer: {CandidateAnswer}
#####################
Guidelines:
You are evaluating the explaianability of the Candidate Answer. 
A truly explainable answer must clearly show the reasoning steps that led to the answer. You always prefer Candidate Answers that explain their reasoning process.
If no explanation of the reasoning strategy is there assign a very low score.
If the reasoning process is shown and is structured, clear and understandable assign a high score.
If the reasoning process is shown, is clear and contains extremely relevant, fully exhaustive and no redundant information assign a very high score.
##################### Instructions: Above is a Candidate Answer to the Question: {Question}.
Please read it carefully along with the Guidelines for how to evaluate an answerâ€™s quality. Then:
1. Critique the Candidate Answer in detail with respect to the Guidelines between "<Critique>" and "</Critique>" tags. Comment on whether the reasoning process is shown and whether it is clear, relevant, exhaustive and non-redundant.
2. Summarise how well the Candidate Answer adheres to the Guidelines in general, between "<Explanation>" and "</Explanation>" tags."
3. Finally, score the Candidate Answer on 1-100, where 100 is a perfect Answer that aligns with the Guidelines and 0 is an Answer with no reasoning steps. Indicate the score between "<Score>" and "</Score>" tags.
When you are finished, conclude your response with "=====".
