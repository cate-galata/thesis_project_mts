Input: Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?
Steps:
The average cost of a US Boeing 737 plane is 1.6 million dollars.
Wonder Woman (2017 film) grossed over 800 million dollars at the box office.
The money grossed by the movie Wonder Woman is much more than the price of a Boeing 737, therefore the cost of a Boeing 737 is covered by Wonder Woman box office receipts.
Answer: true
Input: Can a microwave melt a Toyota Prius battery?
Steps:
A Toyota Prius uses a 202 V nickel-metal hydride battery.
Nickel has a melting point of 2651 F.
Microwaves rarely warm food more than 212 F.
A microwave cannot reach a temperature which is high enough to melt nickel, thus a microwave cannot melt a Toyota Prius battery.
Answer: false
Input: Can you carry a Chrysler in a laptop bag?
Steps:
Chrysler manufactures automobiles, which weigh several thousand pounds.
Laptop bags are designed to hold laptop computers, which typically weigh under ten pounds.
Therefore you could not carry a Chrysler in a laptop bag.
Answer: false
Input: Was Aristotle a member of the House of Lords?
Steps:
Aristotle died in 322 BC.
The House of Lords is grown out of the Model Parliament, which was the first English Parliament.
The Model Parliament was held in 1295.
The House of Lords was established after Aristotle's death, therefore Aristotle could not have been a memeber of the House of Lords.
Answer: false
Input: Can you transport a coin along a sea of mercury?
Steps:
An object will float if it is less dense than the liquid it is placed in.
Mercury is liquid at room temperature.
The density of mercury is 13.56 g/cm3.
The density of a penny is 7.15 g/cm3.
The penny is less dense than marcury therefore it will float.
Answer: true

### DFS ###
propose_prompt = '''If the input is a question, output its best decomposition into subquestions. These subquestions will be used to retrieve information to answer the input question, so they should be able to retrieve all the information needed without any overlaps between them.
Example:
Input: Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?
Output:
Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?
- How much does a Boeing 737 cost?
- How much did the 2017 movie Wonder Woman gross?

If the input is a question decomposition, enhance it by adding subquestions to subquestions only when you still need more information to answer the original question. Subquestions of subquestions are represented as lines following their originator, prefixed by a tab and a hyphen.
Example:
Input:
Can a microwave melt a Toyota Prius battery?
- What material are car batteries made of? 
- What is the maximum temperature a microwave can reach?
Output:
Can a microwave melt a Toyota Prius battery?
- What battery does a Toyota Prius use? 
    - What material is the Toyota Prius battery made of?
    - What is the melting point of the material of a Toyota Prius battery?
- What is the maximum temperature a microwave can reach?

Structure your output exaclty like in the examples.
Also output your confidence level for the entire decomposition at the end choosing one from (certain/high/medium/low), like this: confidence level: (certain/high/medium/low). 
Use "certain" cautiously and only when you are absolutely sure this is the optimal decomposition (i.e. all subquestions are mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive and relevant to answer the question they originate from).
Avoid further decomposition when the existing questions already provide sufficient information to extrapolate the answer. 
If all necessary information to answer the question has been found and thus no further decomposition into subquestions is needed, output: confidence level: stop.

value_prompt = '''Output how likely the current decomposition into subquestions is to answer the original question. Assess if all subquestions can be answered solely with information from your knowledge, and if they contribute relevant information. Output sure/maybe/impossible in the last line.

answer_prompt = '''Given a question decomposition, use it to help you find the answer to the follwing problem: "{original_question}".

propose_prompt_bfs = '''You will get a question as input. Your task is to decompose the question into a minimal number of subquestions
